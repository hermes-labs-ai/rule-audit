"""Bounded rule-audit report for the Claude Code `/rule-audit:audit` command.

This is a thin adapter over the installed `rule-audit` CLI. It adds nothing to
detection and decides nothing about severity: it shells out to
`rule-audit --file=PATH --format json`, then prints a size-bounded rendering of
what came back and re-raises the CLI's own exit code.

Why an adapter script rather than letting the model compose the command:

* **Bounded output.** A real prompt file can produce thousands of findings
  (measured: 1,875 contradictions from a single 124-rule document). Piping that
  into an agent's context is not useful. This caps every family and always
  prints the exact command to see the rest.
* **Bounded input.** `rule_audit.audit` is O(n^2) in parsed rules with no size
  guard of its own. Large inputs are refused with an actionable message rather
  than stalling the session. See `MAX_INPUT_BYTES`.
* **A named runtime.** `rule-audit` on `PATH` is frequently an older release
  than the one a project expects. This resolves a runtime that meets
  `MIN_VERSION` and prints the version it actually used.
* **Determinism.** `generated_at` is never read, so two runs over unchanged
  input produce byte-identical output.

Exit codes are the CLI's, unchanged: 0 = LOW/MEDIUM, 2 = HIGH/CRITICAL,
1 = the audit could not be run.
